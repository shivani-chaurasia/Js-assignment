/*Data types basically specify what kind of data can be stored and manipulated within a program.
There are six basic data types in JavaScript which can be divided into three main categories: primitive and reference
String, Number,Bigint and Boolean, null, undefined are primitive data types. Object, Array, and Function (which are all types of objects) are reference data types.
Primitive data types can hold only one value at a time, whereas reference data types can hold collections of values and more complex entities
